"""FIT parser: the format Garmin devices actually write.

FIT is binary, not XML, so this parser shares the ParsedWorkout contract with
its siblings but none of their XML helpers — including `supports`, which sniffs
the file signature rather than a root element.

A Garmin bulk export keeps every activity in the format it was uploaded in, and
for anything recorded on a Garmin watch that is FIT. Without this parser the
common case — somebody arriving with their whole history — imports nothing.
