"""A minimal FIT writer, so the FIT parser can be tested against real bytes.

FIT is binary, so there is no way to write a fixture by hand the way a TCX or a
GPX one is written. Encoding the handful of message types the parser reads is
cheaper than vendoring sample files from a device — and it means a test can
build the awkward case on purpose rather than hoping a donated file contains it.

Only what the parser needs is here: a 12-byte header, definition and data
messages for one local type at a time, and the FIT CRC. No compressed
timestamps, no developer fields, no multi-byte arrays.

The layout follows the FIT file format: a header naming the payload size, then
records, then a CRC over everything before it. Each record is either a
*definition* — which fields follow, in which order, at which width — or the
*data* matching the definition most recently given for its local type.
